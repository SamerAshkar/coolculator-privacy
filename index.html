    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Coolculator</strong> (the "Application"), created by <strong>Samer Ashkar</strong>, handles your information. I am committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected while you use this service.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Privacy Commitment:</strong> Coolculator is built with privacy as a priority. It does not collect personal data, does not require internet access, and does not share any information with third parties.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
    <p>The Application does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Local Device Storage</h2>
    <p>The Application uses the local storage of your device to save the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Scores:</strong> To keep track of your personal game records within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Session History:</strong> To provide a temporary log of your calculations for your convenience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains <strong>exclusively on your device</strong> and is never uploaded to a server or cloud. This information is automatically deleted if the Application is uninstalled from your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Audio and Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Application generates audio tones and sounds locally using the Web Audio API. It does <strong>not</strong> require or request access to your device's microphone, camera, contacts, or file gallery. No audio data is recorded or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Analytics</h2>
    <p>The Application does not include any third-party analytics (like Firebase or Google Analytics), advertising networks (like AdMob), or external tracking scripts. There is zero background data transmission.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Because the Application collects no personal information, it is safe for users of all ages and is compliant with standard privacy regulations regarding children. It does not solicit any data from users under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a new "Last Updated" date.</p>
